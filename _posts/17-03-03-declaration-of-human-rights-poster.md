title: The UN Declaration of Human Rights
---

I was trying to get a printed copy of the 1948 original, but wasn’t able to find one.

I asked Nhân Nguyễn to remake it as a PDF based on a photograph of the original and the original text.

Here it is for anyone who’s interested. Or, I also have it as an Adobe InDesign file if you prefer.
