You are leaving the American Sector

![Leaving the American Sector Sign](/images/IMG_4289.jpg?raw=true)

This is what remains of the original sign from the checkpoint at Heinrich-Heine Strasse in Berlin.

It was rescued by a friend of mine on the evening when the border was opened. As you can see it’s damaged and we’ve put it in a steel frame to keep the rest of it preserved.
